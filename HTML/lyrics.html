        Ay, ay, ay, ay (ooh)
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)
        Ay, ay
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

        Needless to say, I keep her in check
        She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)
        Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)
        Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)

        Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
        She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
        Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
        Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

        Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
        Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
        Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
        Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt

        Ooh-ooh-ooh
        Some things you just can't refuse
        She wanna ride me like a cruise
        And I'm not tryna lose

        Then you're left in the dust
        Unless I stuck by ya
        You're the sunflower
        I think your love would be too much
        Or you'll be left in the dust
        Unless I stuck by ya
        You're the sunflower
        You're the sunflower

        Every time I'm leavin' on you (ooh)
        You don't make it easy, no (no, no)
        Wish I could be there for you
        Give me a reason to, oh (oh)

        Every time I'm walkin' out
        I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
        Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
        Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (now)

        I know you're scared of the unknown ('known)
        You don't wanna be alone (alone)
        I know I always come and go (and go)
        But it's out of my control

        And you'll be left in the dust
        Unless I stuck by ya
        You're the sunflower
        I think your love would be too much
        Or you'll be left in the dust
        Unless I stuck by ya
        You're the sunflower
        You're the sunflower (yeah)
